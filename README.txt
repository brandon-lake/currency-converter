### TO GET STARTED LOCALLY ###
- cd into currency-converter folder
- run "npm install"
- create a .env file at the same level as the included .env.local file
    - copy all the contents from the .env.local file into your newly created .env file
    - add the API key I sent over email to the .env file as the value for the API_KEY property (no quotation marks, just paste it right in)
