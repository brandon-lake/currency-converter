### TO GET STARTED LOCALLY ###
- cd into currency-converter folder
- run "npm install"
- run "npm start"

### If this were to be hosted on github, you would need to create your own .env file at the same level as the .env.local file,
### then add all fields from the .env.local file to your new .env file.  Then you would have to populate all fields with
### the appropriate data.  Because this is not hosted, I have left the .env file intact with my API key for your convenience.
